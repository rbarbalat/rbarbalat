### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I used to work as an options trader but I am transitioning into a career in software engineering. At the moment, most of my experience in this field is in the form of building full-stack web applications that combine a React/Redux frontend with either a Flask/SQLAlchemy or Express/Sequelize backend and a PostgreSQL database. That said, I am interested in the full spectrum of software development from building applications from scratch to sitting back and just thinking about theoretical topics in computer science. I am open to all opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me.
